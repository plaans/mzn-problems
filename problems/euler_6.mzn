% The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
% 1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385
%
% The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
% (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025
% 
% Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten 
% natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
% 
% Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one 
% hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
