% "A puzzle from James Grime about abcdef"
% http://travels.peterrowlett.net/2012/02/puzzle-from-james-grime-about-abcdef.html
% """
% Today James Grime tweeted this question/puzzle:
% 
% Is there a six digit number abcdef such that the following all hold?
%
%    a+b+c+d+e+f = y
%    ab+cd+ef=10y
%    abc+def=100y
%
% If not, show why not.
%
% A little tweeting back and forth verified that "ab" means 10a+b not a√ób.
