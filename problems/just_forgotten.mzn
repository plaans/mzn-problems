% 
% Joe was furious when he forgot one of his bank account numbers. 
% He remembered that it had all the digits 0 to 9 in some order, so he tried
% the following four sets without success:
%
%     9 4 6 2 1 5 7 8 3 0
%     8 6 0 4 3 9 1 2 5 7 
%     1 6 4 0 2 9 7 8 5 3
%     6 8 2 4 3 1 9 0 7 5
%
% When Joe finally remembered his account number, he realised that in each set
% just four of the digits were in their correct position and that, if one knew
% that, it was possible to work out his account number.
% What was it?
